"Git for Windows SDK" is 5.33GB compared to "Git for Windows" 691MB compared to "Portable Git" 275MB. I use the lean and mean Portable Git. At first, it seems hopeless trying to restore and use pacman in the latter two flavors of Git (msys2), because Google excluded ALL metadata files in /var/lib/pacman/local. Please read this official explanation:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#.22Failed_to_commit_transaction_.28conflicting_files.29.22_error

Without those metadata files, you don't know the exact collection and version of the msys2 packages Google selected to build a release of those 2 flavors of Git. If you force to install or copy the current version of msys2 packages, you run the risk of version mismatch with git binaries Google built and tested.

Well, that's until I discover this file: /etc/package-versions.txt, the laundry list of matching msys2 packages and versions. Now there is a definitive source in github. Here is how I restore pacman in [Portable Git 2.35.3-32-bit][4] (see Dec 8, 2022 comment):

Step 1: Run these commands to download /etc/pacman.conf and 3 packages: [pacman][1], [pacman-mirrors][2] and [msys2-keyring][3]. These are .xz packages before msys2 switched to zstd. See my Jul 8, 2021 comment below.

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msys2/MSYS2-packages/7858ee9c236402adf569ac7cff6beb1f883ab67c/pacman/pacman.conf -o /etc/pacman.conf
    for f in pacman-5.2.2-4-i686 pacman-mirrors-20200329-1-any msys2-keyring-r21.b39fb11-1-any;
     do curl https://repo.msys2.org/msys/i686/$f.pkg.tar.xz -fo ~/Downloads/$f.pkg.tar.xz;
    done

Step 2: Unpack them at the root then restore pacman with these commands:

    cd /
    tar x --xz -vf ~/Downloads/msys2-keyring-r21.b39fb11-1-any.pkg.tar.xz usr
    tar x --xz -vf ~/Downloads/pacman-mirrors-20200329-1-any.pkg.tar.xz etc
    tar x --xz -vf ~/Downloads/pacman-5.2.2-4-i686.pkg.tar.xz usr
    mkdir -p /var/lib/pacman
    pacman-key --init
    pacman-key --populate msys2
    pacman -Syu

Step 3: The next two commands restore all matching metadata. The second command is multi-line but still safe to cut and paste (be patient):

    URL=https://github.com/git-for-windows/git-sdk-32/raw/git-2.35.3
    cat /etc/package-versions.txt | while read p v; do d=/var/lib/pacman/local/$p-$v;
     mkdir -p $d; echo $d; for f in desc files mtree; do curl -fsSL "$URL$d/$f" -o $d/$f;
     done; done

Step 4: Now, is it too much to ask for 'make' and 'zip'?

    pacman -S make zip

Voil√†, still just a 337MB mean little environment that can expand and upgrade!
